# I'm Organized!
 
* **Purpose of the app:** 
   This app was created to give the teacher an easy and interactive way to organize their classes, display their lessons, and create customizable and interactive lesson plans.


* **Features on the app:**
    The homepage first allows you to login and/or register. Once logged in, the user is given the option of creating a class with a customizable 'name' and 'level' of the class. Once the user creates a class they can access that class and create lesson plans for each day of the week.
